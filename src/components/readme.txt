## GENERAL RULES

1. Only shared components used across features are placed here.
2. All the components should be registered and exported from /index.js for a single access point.
3. All the components should bear named export. This will avoid any conflicts.

TIP: Try to create named-exports instead of default exports for all the components. This will avoid any naming conflicts.
